## Tools found during research

pylint (pyreverse) - If i try to remove the test folders, information is lost. I haven't found any good way to make it so I can safely remove test files wihout loss of information. Example is `topics.py` imports `TopicFilter` yet there is no connection in the output between `topics.py` and `TopicFilter`
py2puml - Doesn't work. Couldn't make it work without having the domain files as they show in their own example. Since zeegu doesn't have this it doesn't seem to work. Found old examples of someone using it from code, but still it seems that you need the domain file for py2puml to work.
pyviz - Looks like a collection of different visualization frameworks
bokeh - part of pyviz as far as i can tell
codemap - yet to use

understand (scitools) - yet to use
