# TODO

+ remember to write about how to use tool
+ remember to talk about depencies this tool have
+ remember to include the jar file (where to find and why it is necessary)

+ Make good views with archlens
+ get gittruck up and running
  + Is there anything notable we can deduct from Gittruck -> Maybe it gives another view on what components are important. Maybe a component is solid and a lot points to it, but another component might experience frequent changes as it is important for the system at hand.
+ get code quality with modu (own bachelor project)
+ get some better views with pyreverse and preferrably do it with uml.
    + Along this, maybe add some more to the scripts either predefined or add some customizability.
+ Start analyzing the diagram outputs to find relevant modules to include in a final UML class diagram
+ Speak of limitations of existing tools
+ What would I have done better another time, perhaps given more time
+ Potential views that could have been added (maybe if time allows)
+ Other notable observations from not only the diagrams, but maybe gittruck and code quality
+
